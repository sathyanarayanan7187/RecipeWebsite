                <p>Chicken Malai Tikka is a creamy and mildly spiced appetizer. Boneless chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of fresh cream, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chili paste, and a blend of spices like garam masala and white pepper. After marinating for a few hours, the chicken is skewered and grilled until tender and juicy. The result is succulent, melt-in-the-mouth chicken with a rich, creamy flavor that’s enhanced by the smokiness from the grill.
