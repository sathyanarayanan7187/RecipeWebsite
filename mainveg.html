                <p>Paneer Butter Masala is a creamy and mildly spiced North Indian dish. Cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) are simmered in a rich tomato-based gravy made with butter, cream, and a blend of aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves). The gravy is smooth, slightly sweet, and tangy, perfectly complementing the soft paneer. This dish is typically served with naan, roti, or steamed rice, making it a popular choice for vegetarians.
